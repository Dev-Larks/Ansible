==Chapter 2 notes==

Playbooks are introduced
A playbook is a list of plays (dictionaries)
Every play must contain:
* A set of hosts to configure
* A list of tasks to be executed

web-notls.yml
This playbook configures an nginx server that supports http only
This playbook requires a 'files' directory be present which contains the nginx.conf file.
A second directory called 'templates' is also required to hold the custom webserver index.html template
The hosts file is modified by creating a [webservers] group which contains the Vagrant testserver
* confirm if hosts file needs to be updated with correct IP address details.

ansible webservers -m ping

ansible-playbook web-notls.yml

When the playbook completes you should be able to access the webserver at http://localhost:8080


web-tls.yml
This playbook configures a nginx server that supports https

A TLS certificate is generated using the below command:
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -subj /CN=localhost \
    -keyout files/nginx.key -out files/nginx.crt

This generates the nginx.key and nginx.crt files which are created in the files directory

It also uses variables to hold the locations that the files need to be placed in.

An additional nginx.conf.j2 template file is used to define where to place the .crt and .key files

ansible-playbook web-tls.yml

When the playbook completes you should be able to access the webserver at https://localhost:8443
