==Chapter 3: Inventory==

The inventory file can be called any name but needs to be referenced in the ansible.cfg file.

You can group servers in the inventory file by environment, function or other metric

[vagrant]
vagrant1 ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2222
vagrant2 ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2200
vagrant3 ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2201

[web]
vagrant1

[task]
vagrant2

[db]
vagrant3


You can explicitly reference the local machine by adding an entry in the inventory file in this format.
localhost ansible_connection=local

This chapter uses Vagrant to create 3x VMs

ansible vagrant2 -a "ip addr show dev eth0"

ansible all -a "date"

An inventory file can have both host and group variables defined in it however, best practice is to keep these separate and use host_vars and group_vars directories to contain this information.

Dynamic Inventory
sudo pip install paramiko

I could not get the dynamic inventory file to work has str and byte errors.
